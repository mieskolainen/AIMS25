#: description: Axis error includes +- 1/1 contribution (The overall uncertainty in the bin-to-bin polar acceptance due to shower corrections, trigger and reconstruction efficiencies was estimated to be less than 1% and was added in quadrature to the statistical errorsData have been corrected for qed radiative effects up to order alpha**3 (F.A.Berends, R.Kleiss, Nucl.Phys.B206(1983)61)//Weak radiative corrections have not yet been provided in a form of a Monte Carlo generator program, but are estimated to be negligible at PETRA energies (M.Bohm, A.Denner, W.Hollik, DESY-86-165)).
